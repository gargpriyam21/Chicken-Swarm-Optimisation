# Chicken-Swarm-Optimisation

### Brief Introduction

Chicken Swarm Optimisation (CSO), which is a recently developed bio-inspired algorithm, is proposed for optimization applications. Bio-inspired algorithms proved to very beneficial for solving optimization problems. This repository contains code for Chicken Swarm OPtimisation applied on Cervical Cancer and Breast Cancer. It has been used for feature selection task.

### Dataset

Cervical Cancer (Risk Factors) Dataset and Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) Dataset which are publicly available at the UCI machine learning repository are passed through the proposed Chicken Swarm Optimisation Algorithm.

[Breast Cancer](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Original))

### Result

The proposed Chicken Swarm Optimisation algorithm resulted in the reduction in the calculation time of the prediction as the results were calculated within a few seconds only.

### Requirements

To run the code, you first need to install the following prerequisites: 

* Python 3.5 or above
* PyTorch
* numpy
* matplotlib
* pandas
